                  Read ASCII Point Data - PNTDATA
                 ====================================

PNTDATA is an MDL application which will run under any version of
MicroStation 4.x.  This application is used to convert a column formatted
ASCII X,Y,Z data files into IGDS design files.  This application has been
designed to place spot elevation text for river soundings.  This application
requires a parameter file to exist prior to executing the command.  The
parameter file which has a default extension of .prm contains information
about the order of the data in the ASCII point file.

                    To Run PNTDATA
                  ==================

1. Set a BSI environment variable PNTDATA_PRM to point to the
default parameter file.

    DOS   add following line to \ustation\data\uconfig.dat
        PNTDATA_PRM=d:\corps\pntdata.prm    <-- put in your own .prm file name
    UNIX
        export PNTDATA_PRM=/usr#/corps/pntdata.prm  <--- put in login .env file

2. Copy the .ma file to a directory on the path defined by MS_MDL
   (/ustation/mdlapps by default)


3. Start up MicroStation and keyin "mdl l pntdata".
